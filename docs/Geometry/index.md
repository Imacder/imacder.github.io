I've always looked for a general strategy to solve geometry problems beside converting it into pure algebra.
Recently, I've had some breakthroughs in developing such a strategy, particularly in rotation & linear transformation.


This section includes some of my results. I'll keep expanding this section to include more. 

Basic Division:

* [Linear Transformation](LinTrans.md) (LinTrans)
* Basic Structures (including some nonlinearties) (BS)
* Rotations (rot)
* Half-angle Constructions ($\frac{\alpha}{2}$)
* Line Construction
    - Parallel Lines
    - Intersecting Lines
* Circles
    - Basics (circ)
    - Centers of a Triangle
        - incenter (ic)
        - circumcenter (cc)
        - othocenter (oc)
