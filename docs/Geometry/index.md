I've always looked for a general strategy to solve geometry problems beside converting it into pure algebra.
Recently, I've had some breakthroughs in developing such a strategy, particularly in rotation & linear transformation.


This section includes some of my results. I'll keep expanding this section to include more. 

Basic Division:

* [Linear Transformation](LinTrans.md) (LinTrans)
* [Basic Structures and Ideas](Basic%20Structures%20and%20Ideas.md) (including some nonlinearties) (BS)
* [Rotations](Rotation/Basic%20Rotation.md) (rot)
* [Half-angle Constructions](Half%20Angle%20Construction.md) ($\frac{\alpha}{2}$)
* [Line Construction](Line%20Construction/index.md)
    - [Parallel Lines](Line%20Construction/Parallel%20Lines/index.md)
    - [Intersecting Lines](Line%20Construction/Intersecting%20Lines/index.md)
* [Circles](Circles/index.md)
    - [Basics](Circles/Basic%20Structures.md) (circ)
    - [Centers of a Triangle](Circles/Centers%20of%20Triangle.md)
