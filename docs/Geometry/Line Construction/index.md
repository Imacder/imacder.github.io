# Introduction

I've thought about the naming of this section, ended up with "Line Construction". As the name says, this section basically covers how we can construct to relate graphs primarily made up of lines. These are also the main constructions we can use in similar triangles (other than rotation which is universal.)

This is essentially a replacement for 1st order equations in analytic geometry. (By "replacement", I MEAN replacement. Anything you can do with 1st order equations, you can do with methods in this section.)

There're two kinds of structures: [Parallel Lines](Parallel%20Lines/index.md) & [Intersecting Lines]()
