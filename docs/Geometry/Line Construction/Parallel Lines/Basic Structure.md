# Basic Struture

This is the MOST basic structures in this [Line Construction](../index.md). Everything else stems from here.

## Properties

1. $\frac{AC}{DC} = \frac{BC}{EC} = \frac{AB}{DE}$
2. $DE \parallel AB$
3. $\frac{CD}{AD} = \frac{CE}{BE}$ (this is derived from the first)

Any single property (except SSA case) can be used to derive the other poperties

## Use Case

* Used when the segments in the ratio are **COLINEAR** &rArr; construct parallel lines with one end being the ratio.
* Used when the segemnts in the ratio are **PARALLEL** &rArr; extend the end vecticies to intersect.
* Used when the segments in the ratio have a **common vertex** &rArr; construct parallel line of the segment of non-common vertex. 

This basically covers everything, which is expected, as this can subsitute analytic geometry.
