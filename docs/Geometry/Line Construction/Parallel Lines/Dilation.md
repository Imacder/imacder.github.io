# Dilation

You might find that simply using the [Basic Structure](Basic%20Structure.md) doesn't yield any results (this happens whenever you can't 
find another segment that intersects the current and can link to another itself). Then try moving both of them out together,
namely, using dilation, to a scale where other conditions can be put into use.

## Properties

$$ \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{A'B'}{B'C'} $$

## Use Case

Used when two segments share a vertex, and a line goes through one of the three vertices (preferably the shared one).

Also, this method doesn't require the segments to be collinear (though most of the time they are.)
