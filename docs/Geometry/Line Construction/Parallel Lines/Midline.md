# Midline

Though this section is called midline, the results doesn't only apply to the midpoints. It's only that midpoint are the
most common.

## Construction

Given a trapezoid $ABCD$ ($AB \parallel CD$). $E ,\, F$ are on $AD ,\, BC$, $\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{BF}{BC} = k$.

## Properties

1. $EF \parallel AB \parallel CD$
2. $EF = k CD + (1 - k) AB$

## Use Case

1. There are many collinear segments with ratio $k$ &rArr; construct the same ratio and connect midpoints.
2. $k = \frac{1}{2}$ + add / subtrack segments &rArr; midline of trapezoid.
3. $kCD$ &rArr; "midline" with ratio $k$
