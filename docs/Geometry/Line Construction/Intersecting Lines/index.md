# Introduction

This is one of the two main parts of similar triangles (the other is [Parallel Lines](../Parallel%20Lines/index.md).)

The structures here are basically the structures in parallel lines + reflection. This also contains connections
to [circles](../../Circles/Similar%20Triangles%20in%20Circle.md). Products (instead of ratios) are more commonly used.
In fact, all ratios can be written as products, but their order is usually reversed, making them mostly useless.
However, here the reflection flips the order, and makes the product easier to think about than ratios.

This type of structure can also be thought of as a non-linear transformation.

Though the section is called Intersecting Lines, most kinds of intersection problems actually uses [Parallel Lines](../Parallel%20Lines/index.md).
The "intersect" actually means that the corresponding side of the similar triangles intersect.
