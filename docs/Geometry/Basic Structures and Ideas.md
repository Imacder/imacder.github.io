# Basic Structures and Ideas

This is basically a cheatsheet of all the useful structures.

## List of Structures

1. [Fixed Length &rArr; Circle](Circles/Basic%20Structures.md#fixed-length)
2. [Fixed Angle + Fixed Length &rArr; Circle](Circles/Basic%20Structures.md#fixed-angle)
3. [Fixed Ratio to Fixed Endpoints &rArr; Circle](Circles/Basic%20Structures.md#fixed-ratio-fixed-length)
4. All the [Linear Transformation](LinTrans.md) Techniques
5. [Inversion (Reflection About Circle)](Line%20Construction/Intersecting%20Lines/Special%20Case.md#inversion)

## List of Ideas

1. Any construction you made must connect ast least 2 conditions. Otherwise, it would be a dangling construction,
    and the amount of information you can get out of this auxiliary constructing is the same as the amount you
    constructed, so you will get no new information.
2. After constructing auxiliary lines, try to reframe the original problem in the new (simpler) figure.
3. Try to find relationships between all angles and segments to see if there is some special relationship if there
    is no clear path forward.
4. Try to use transformation to ensure the parts you are trying to relate are in the same orientation, scale, and chirality.
5. When trying to find a locus of a point, try finding a fixpoint related to the point, then find the locus via the relationship.
6. Try simpler versions of the problem (special cases) to get of feeling of the problem.
