## Problem

Given point $P$ moving on $\odot O$, and two fixed endpoints $A$ and $B$. Find $\min(\frac{AP}{BP})$ (or max.)

[//]: # (TODO: add figure)

## Idea 1

We find that the ratio is very hard to cope with. Therefore, we try to transform it to the minimum length of a single
segment via similar triangles.

### Solution 1

[//]: # (TODO: add figure)

We try to reflect $\triangle ABP$ so that $BP$ is transformed to $AB$ (sA-type: $\triangle ABP \sim \triangle QBA$). 
Now we try to minimize $\frac{AQ}{AB}$, but $AB$ in known, so we minimize $AQ$. 

Notice that $BP \cdot BQ = AB ^ 2$, this is an inversion. We can derive the locus of $Q$ based on $P$, then $\min(AQ)$
is trivial.

### Solution 2

[//]: # (TODO: add figure)

We try to rotate $\triangle ABP$ so that $BP$ is transformed to $BO$ (basic rotation: $\triangle ABP \sim \triangle QBO$).
This also gives us $\triangle ABQ \sim \triangle PBO$. We try to minimize $QO$.

We can use inversion again of course ($BP \cdot BQ = AB \cdot OB$), but this is slow. Notice that $\frac{PO}{BO}$ is known.
By the similar triangle, we can get $\frac{AQ}{BQ} = \frac{PO}{BO}$. We can solve this with Apollonius Circle.

### Note

Usually other fixed segments will do as well. And sometimes they can give even simpler answers. An example of this
is 2025 T25.3: we can use [similar triangles in circle](../Circles/Similar%20Triangles%20in%20Circle.md#outside-quadrilateral)
(the external case).

## Idea 2

We try to use Ptolemy's Theorem by construction the inequality with homogenous terms in terms of $AP$ and $BP$.

### Solution 3

[//]: # (TODO: add figure)

The current points $A ,\, B ,\, O ,\, P$ doesn't given homogenous terms. We need the sides of the quadrilateral to
be all in terms of $AP$ and the diagonals to be in terms of $BP$. 

An easy way to do this will be to treat $\odot O$ as a Apollonius Circle. By constructing the corresponding point of
$A$ ($Q$), we can create another segment ($PQ$) in terms of $AP$. Then the problem can be solved by applying Ptolemy
on the quadrilateral $ABQP$.
