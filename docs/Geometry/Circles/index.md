# Introduction

Most circles are hidden inside the figures, they are a crucial yet often overlooked part of geometry problem-solving.

The reason behind its wide usage is how simple it is to [construct](Basic%20Structures.md) it, and how there are so many ways to construct it.
Any fixed length, fixed angle, equal angles (except when the sides are parallel), fixed ratio will produce a circle.
Even in scenarios such as the [Co-vertex Half Angle](../Half%20Angle%20Construction.md#co-vertex), there are circles hidden, 
just because the angle's relationship happens to be right. It also has many properties, serving as a bridge to connects 
angles (with equal arcs, etc.) and lengths (equal radii, Ptolemy, etc.)

Circles can be constructed with rotated angles, therefore nearly any rotation will [generate circles](../Rotation/Basic%20Rotation.md#properties).
It can also be used to construct rotations backwards.

Circles have connection to a triangle's various centers. Many of those centers' properties need circle + similar triangles for derivation.
These are the hardest kinds of problems in circle geometry.
