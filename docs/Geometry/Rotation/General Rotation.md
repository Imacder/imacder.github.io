# General Rotation

In [Basic Rotation](Basic%20Rotation.md), we've covered the rotation of segments.
Here we'll talk about the rotation of triangles.

This is an idea, rather than actual construction. So some of the construction is actually redundant and is only useful for thinking.

## Construction

1. [Construct the rotational center for one edge](Basic%20Rotation.md#finding-rotational-center).
2. Connect vertices to the rotational center, and use [Basic Rotation](./Basic%20Rotation.md).

## Basic Idea

Sometimes the connection to rotational center is unnecessary. However, we usually do need to know that the figure in 
question DOES contain such a rotation. Usually, either only constructing the rotated triangle or using the center of 
rotation will yield a solution. But in special circumstances, the only way forward is with the rotational center. In 
these case, we can try to combine sides from different rotational pairs to construct a new rotational pair.

## Examples

1. L3A (which has its own set of ideas)
2. R1
3. R6 (天河期末, to be included)
